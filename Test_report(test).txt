yaml troubleshooting

■ doesn't work with the non ASCII symbols in the name of .csv file (Using only ASCII files)
■ doesn't work with empty "filters" field in config.yaml file (Fixed)
■ works with spaces (Okay)
■ can't plot any kind of graphics with non integer values (E.g. "QueueName") (Fixed, returning histogram for it)
■ hard to read graphics with the big numbers in x axis (E.g. "WallDurationSeconds", exmaple in the graph folder) (We have x_scale for this)
■ doesn't work when filters are too strict (no data that fits in specific given requirements) (Fixed)
